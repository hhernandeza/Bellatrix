I had a really scary experience when I went to 
posuzo with my chio.

In fact, we arrived to posuzo in the afternoon, the views were amazing and incredibly beautiful


But when we came back to the La merced, because our hotel was in that city, suddenly the truck tire was pricked
in middle of a desert high road

Yes, I thought that car had a spare tire but they didn't have 

Oh, We were very annoying with the tour company that we contracted

The person in charge said, we have to walk in the middle of the road to came back to La Merced

But, guess what happened, it started to rain, a quite quite big rain, we had to run for protect us for the rain

It rained almost one hour and when the rain stopped, it was a darkness sky and there wasn't a moon so it was very very dark
I almost couldn't see the other persons and my chio started to cry.

Yeah, but fortunatly a Car suddenly appear and all of us got into the car and we came back to La merced

All in all, It was pretty horrendous night, and I don't think either my chio or I, are in a hurry to go to Posuzo again!
